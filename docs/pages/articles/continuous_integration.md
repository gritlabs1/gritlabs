# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice in which developers regularly merge code changes into a shared repository. Each merge triggers an automated build and test process, ensuring that new commits integrate smoothly with the existing codebase. The approach aims to catch defects early and promote a reliable release cadence.

## Overview

The CI workflow typically involves a version control system, a build server, and a suite of automated tests. When a developer pushes changes, the build server retrieves the latest code, compiles it if necessary, and runs the test suite. A successful build provides immediate feedback, while failures alert developers to integration issues that can be addressed quickly.

## History

The concept of continuous integration grew out of the Agile movement in the early 2000s, although precursors existed in earlier software engineering practices. Tools such as CruiseControl and later Jenkins popularized automated pipelines, making CI accessible to a wider range of teams. Over time, cloud-based platforms have further reduced the barrier to entry, allowing organizations of all sizes to adopt CI.

## Benefits

* **Early defect detection** – Automated tests run on every change, reducing the likelihood of integration surprises later in the cycle.
* **Faster feedback loops** – Developers receive near-immediate confirmation that their code works as expected.
* **Consistent builds** – A standardized pipeline ensures that artifacts are produced in a repeatable manner.
* **Improved team collaboration** – Frequent merges encourage smaller, incremental updates that are easier to review and maintain.

## Common Tools

Several open-source and commercial tools support CI workflows, including Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI. While the specific features differ, all provide a mechanism to automate builds and tests in response to repository events.
