# Best Practices for Closing Pull Requests

Closing a PR is more than a housekeeping task. Whether you're merging or
discarding, a clear process ensures contributors feel respected and your
repository stays tidy.

### 1. Confirm the Outcome

Make sure all discussions are resolved and the final commit is ready. If the
work is incomplete or replaced, explain why it won't be merged.

### 2. Document the Reason

Leave a short comment summarizing why you're closing the PR. This helps
maintainers and future contributors understand your decision.

### 3. Clean Up Branches

After merging or closing, delete stale branches to prevent clutter and
confusion.

### 4. Update References

If the PR is tied to an issue, close or reference the issue so it's clear the
work is complete.

### 5. Acknowledge Contributors

Thank the author for their effort. A little recognition encourages continued
collaboration.

Handled well, a closed pull request keeps your history clean and your community
