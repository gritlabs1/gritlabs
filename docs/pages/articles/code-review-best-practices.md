# Code Review Best Practices

Code reviews are more than bug hunts. They're collaborative checkpoints for sharing knowledge and keeping your codebase healthy. Whether your team ships daily or monthly, thoughtful reviews make every release stronger.

## 1. Keep Pull Requests Focused

Small, well-scoped pull requests are easier to review. Limit each PR to a single feature or bug fix so reviewers can follow the logic without digging through unrelated changes.

## 2. Explain the Why

A clear description and context help reviewers understand your choices. Link to relevant issues, diagrams, or documentation. When reviewers know the problem you're solving, they can offer better feedback.

## 3. Use Automated Checks

Automated tests and linters catch routine problems before human reviewers even look at the code. Make sure your pipeline runs and passes before requesting review. This lets reviewers focus on logic and architecture instead of style issues.

## 4. Review for Readability

Code that is easy to read is easier to maintain. Encourage consistent formatting, descriptive naming, and comments where necessary. If something is complex, add a short explanation so future developers aren't left guessing.

## 5. Ask Questions, Not Demands

Review comments should spark conversation. If you see a potential issue, ask for clarification rather than ordering changes. Collaborative dialogue leads to better solutions and a stronger team culture.

## 6. Acknowledge Good Work

Positive feedback matters. Call out clever solutions or improvements you appreciate. Recognition builds trust and makes code reviews feel like shared victories instead of gatekeeping.

### Conclusion

Code reviews are a lightweight ritual with big returns. By keeping pull requests focused, providing context, and emphasizing collaboration, your team can ship quality code and learn from each other along the way.
