# #00002 — Roulette wheel was spinning oddly

**Status:** Resolved
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-08

The roulette wheel occasionally accelerated unexpectedly. Commit [`535f019`](https://github.com/gritlabs1/gritlabs/commit/535f019) revised the spin logic so each spin starts from the correct position and stops smoothly.
