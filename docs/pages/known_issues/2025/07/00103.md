# #00103 — Theme fails to load offline

**Status:** In Progress  
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-08  

When browsing without internet connectivity, style sheets may not load, leaving the site unstyled. This occurs because certain assets are fetched from a CDN at runtime.

**Workaround**: Reconnect to the internet and refresh the page to reapply the theme.
