# #00102 — Scroll jitter when switching tabs

**Status:** Won’t Fix  
**Date Reported:** 2025-07-07  

Some users observe a brief scrolling jump when returning to a previously opened tab. The effect is caused by inherent limitations in the current JavaScript framework.

**Notes / Workaround**: Because the issue is minor and does not affect core functionality, no fix is planned. Accept the momentary jitter when switching tabs.
