# Task List

CODEX_TODO: 


Creating a lightweight, non-database JavaScript app is a great idea for testing a proof of concept with Codex to have it write apps and deploy them. Here's an idea for a simple app that could be a good test case:

### Idea: **Task List App with Local Storage**

#### Features:

* **Add a task**: The user can input a task and add it to a list.
    
* **Mark as completed**: The user can mark tasks as completed (with a checkbox or a toggle button).
    
* **Delete a task**: The user can delete a task from the list.
    
* **Persistent storage**: Use the browser's `localStorage` to store the tasks, so that the app persists even after the browser is closed and reopened (no external database required).
    

#### Structure:

* **HTML**: Simple structure with an input box for new tasks, a button to add them, and a list to display tasks.
    
* **CSS**: Basic styling for layout and task differentiation (completed vs. incomplete).
    
* **JavaScript**:
    
    * Use `localStorage` to store and retrieve tasks.
        
    * Add tasks with a button or enter key.
        
    * Toggle task completion with a checkbox or button.
        
    * Implement task deletion.
        

#### How this aligns with the concept:

* **Simple**: The app is easy to understand and can demonstrate how Codex can generate working, complete applications.
    
* **No backend/database**: Uses `localStorage`, which is stored client-side, so thereâ€™s no need for an actual database.
    
* **User input**: You get the chance to see how Codex handles form data, event handling, and local storage, which are fundamental concepts in web apps.
    
* **Interactive**: The app allows for interaction, showing how Codex handles user-driven actions like adding, marking, and deleting tasks.
    

#### Steps for testing:

1. Codex can write the entire app (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
    
2. You can test it in the browser, ensuring Codex handles user interaction and local storage correctly.
    
3. If Codex can deploy this locally or onto a hosting service, it will be a clear test of how well it can generate deployable apps.
    

This would be a great lightweight app for a Codex-based proof of concept, demonstrating both frontend app development and how Codex can manage app states and persistence without a database.
