# App of the Day

Welcome to **App of the Day**, a small corner of Grit Labs where we ask Codex to
build a tiny, self contained application.  Each entry showcases how a language
model can turn a short specification into runnable code.  These projects are not
meant to be production readyâ€”instead they serve as simple, reproducible
examples you can explore or extend on your own.

The first featured project is a Task List application written in vanilla
JavaScript.  It stores tasks locally in your browser so no backend is required.
Check out the source and try it yourself!
