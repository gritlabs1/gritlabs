# Dependency Modeling

---

## 📌 Overview

Grit Labs uses explicit **Dependency Modeling** to structure relationships between reusable **Components**, aligning closely with specific goals or tasks. The level of detail and what to include in the modeling are intentionally selective, emphasizing clarity and relevance rather than exhaustive coverage.

---

## 📐 Core Concepts

* **Component**:

  * Reusable building block.
  * May represent a physical object, concept, or functional unit.

* **Dependency**:

  * Represents a relationship where understanding or implementing a dependent component requires another component (its dependency).

* **Relationships**:

  * Always directional "depends-on" relationships.
  * Explicitly defined; no implied hierarchies.

## 📚 Database Structure

### Component Catalog

- Stores all unique Components.
- No self-references permitted.

### Component Dependencies

- Records explicit dependency relationships between components.
- Includes an optional Parent Component reference (`ParentComponentId`).

## 🔗 Entity Relationship Overview

```plaintext
[ComponentCatalog] 1 -------- 0..* [ComponentDependencies] 0..* -------- 1 [ComponentCatalog]
                                               |
                                               └── 0..1 [EntryPoints]
                                                              |
                                                              └── 0..* [UseCases] 1 -------- 1..* [ApplicationCases]
```

---

## 🎯 Entry Points

* Only select dependencies act as entry points.
* Entry points link directly to Use Cases.

---

## 🚩 Use Cases

* Describe what a "Product" type Component does.
* Associated explicitly with entry-point components.
* Provide justification for the existence of Components.

---

## ✅ Application Cases

* Practical demonstrations of Use Cases.
* Include clearly defined problems and corresponding solutions.
* Serve as validation examples.

---

## 📦 Component Dependency Types

Each dependency recorded in `ComponentDependencies` has an explicitly defined dependency type:

* **White-box**:

  * Complete knowledge of internal workings (recursive dependencies).
  * Fully documented dependency relationships.
  * Explicitly understood dependent relationships.

* **Black-box**:

  * Zero knowledge of internal component workings.
  * Dependency relationship documented.
  * No dependent relationships documented.

* **Product**:

  * Partial knowledge of internal workings, specific to supporting particular Use Cases.
  * Dependency relationships fully documented.
  * Dependent relationships exist only within the defined Use Case scope.

---

## 🌲 Dependency Trees and Reusability

* Components form explicit dependency trees, intentionally creating a reusable "forest" of components.
* A single component may appear in multiple contexts.
* Structure is local to the topmost dependent node to ensure reusability.
* Parent-child terminology indicates relational directionality (dependent-to-dependency) but with an explicit reversal in Grit Labs:

  * In Grit Labs, a "parent" is always dependent on the "child" component.

> **Analogy**: Consider a tree farm where ornaments (components) can be projected across multiple trees simultaneously, emphasizing intentional reuse and locality of structure.

---

## 🔄 Alignment with Goals and Actions

* Components and dependencies explicitly align with goals (`GOALS.md`) and Action Items (`ACTION_SCHEMA.md`).
* Dependency modeling evolves iteratively through Rotations (`DIRECTIVE.md`).
* Validation via Use Cases and Application Cases directly supports Action Item completion and goal verification.
